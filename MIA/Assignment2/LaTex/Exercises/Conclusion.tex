\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion we have seen where segmentation can be used in medical image analysis, we have seen the risks of dilation and erosion and explained the benefits of them, we have concluded Graph cut segmentations are preferred, but also have limited applications and Random walker alleviates these constrains by being non-deterministic, and finally we have looked into how PCA can be used for segmentation.
