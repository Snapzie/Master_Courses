\section{Image registration}
Image registration is the problem of aligning two similar images such that their main features overlap. Applications of image registration ranges from two images of the 'real world' taken of the same scene with slightly different angles, to when an x-ray and an MRI scan, both sharing similar modalities, needs to be aligned or when the results of a treatment needs to be compared based on a follow up scan, to when an MRI scan, which shows structure, needs to be aligned with a PET scan, which could show tumor growth, where these scans do not share the same modality. Similar for all applications we would like to perform a transformation on one image, which gives us the same image, but seen in the perspective / space of the other, such that the two images becomes the most similar.
