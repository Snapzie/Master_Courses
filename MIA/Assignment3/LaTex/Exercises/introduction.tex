\section{Introduction}
This week we will look at registration and what problems registration solves, we will then look at similarity measures and what roles they play in registration. We will then look at regularization and how we can use regularization to penalize unwanted behaviour in our registration. Next we take a look at three kind of transformations which we can perform with registration and what the difference is between them. Lastly we will take a look at a non-rigid registration performed in python.
