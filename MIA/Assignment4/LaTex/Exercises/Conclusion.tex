\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion we have seen CNNs are build by using convolutions and we have defined cross validation and when it can be useful. We have also seen a U-Net model predict quite good segmentations for lung data. And we have evaluated the performance of our retrained skin lesion classifier, by measuring accuracy, area under the ROC curve and area under the precision / recall curve.
