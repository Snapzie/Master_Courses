\section{Introduction}
In this week we will take a look at the Radon transform and how it is defined. We will then conduct experiments to see if we can more intuitively explain how a sinogram is constructed. Then we will prove that the Radon transform is linear and explain why this is in a intuitive way. We will end by looking at the back projection and the filtered back projection and by looking at some reconstructions made by each technique.
