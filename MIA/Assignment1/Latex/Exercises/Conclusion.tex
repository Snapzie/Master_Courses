\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion we have seen the definition of the radon transform and the advantage of explaining it in polar coordinates. We have seen and explained how sinograms are produced by conducting several experiments. We have also proven the linearity of the Radon transform, and explained the linearity more intuitively. Lastly we have seen the back projection and the filtered back projection and shown several reconstructions of varying degrees of quality.
