\section{Results}In this section the results of the thesis work is presented. First we will take a look at some examples images from two endoscopy videos to familiarize ourselves a little with the data the models have been trained on. We will then look at the model selection and how the best performing model was chosen, followed by the separation point predictions of the post-processing approaches. Next we look at the treatment predictions from the segmentation results of the 2D ResNet, before we try and refine these results by a using U-Net model. To end with, we use the U-Net segmentations for treatment predictions. In \autoref{exampleFrames} we see four examples of training data from two different endoscopy videos and two different patients. In the left column we have examples of inflamed bowel tissue and in the right column examples of healthy bowel tissue. The top row of images is from the same video and likewise, the bottom row of images is from the same video. We note how even though the image pairs comes from the same patient, the colouring of the bowel tissue can change quite a lot throughout a video, which especially is seen in the bottom row of images. We also note, how much the colon twists has a large impact on the lighting, and thus on the colouring of the tissue. And lastly we also see from image (a) and (d) how similar healthy and inflamed tissue can look. \begin{figure}[H]	\centering	\begin{subfigure}{0.4\linewidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Materials/Results/Intro/idx_1_frame_830}		\caption{Inflamed example image from validation video.}	\end{subfigure}	\hspace{0.5cm}	\begin{subfigure}{0.4\linewidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Materials/Results/Intro/idx_1_frame_1210}		\caption{Healthy example image from validation video.\newline}	\end{subfigure}	\\	\begin{subfigure}{0.4\linewidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Materials/Results/Intro/idx_4_frame_800}		\caption{Inflamed example image.}	\end{subfigure}	\hspace{0.5cm}	\begin{subfigure}{0.4\linewidth}		\centering		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Materials/Results/Intro/idx_4_frame_3000}		\caption{Healthy example image.}	\end{subfigure}	\caption{Examples images from two endoscopy videos.}	\label{exampleFrames}\end{figure}\input{Exercises/Results/ModelSelection}\input{Exercises/Results/SP}\input{Exercises/Results/TreatmentResults}\input{Exercises/Results/UnetSegmentation}\input{Exercises/Results/UnetTreatmentResults}
