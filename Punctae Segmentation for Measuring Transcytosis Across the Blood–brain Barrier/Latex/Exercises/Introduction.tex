\section{Motivation}
The blood-brain barrier is an interface separating the brain form the circulatory system \cite{swhati}. The very restrictive nature of the blood-brain barrier, only allowing certain small molecules to pass, makes it a big obstacle in central nervous system drug delivery \cite{swhati}. Defects in the blood-brain barrier have also been reported in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease patients, connecting the two diseases to the blood-brain barrier \cite{zhao}. For these reasons research in the blood-brain barrier and its permeability is important. When studying the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, tracer molecules are injected into the brain of mice which then accumulate around the blood-brain barrier interface. With two-photon microscopy we can see and measure the concentration of these tracer molecules. However, quantifying these accumulations is very subjective, non-trivial and time consuming, even for experts, and for these reasons this project aims to explore the possibilities of training and validating a deep learning model for automatic segmentation of accumulation of these tracer molecules.
