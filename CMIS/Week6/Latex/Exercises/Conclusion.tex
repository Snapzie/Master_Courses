\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion we have seen due to how the shared surfaces cancel out when we apply Gauss-Divergence theorem, we have both global and local conservation. We have also seen how the shape of our control volumes plays a big role in FVM and how it can introduce errors if we do not get it right. Lastly we conclude there has been introduced errors into our model, and most likely due to how we handle the control volumes which are both inside and outside the unit circle, but in broad lines our model meets our expectations.
