\section{Introduction}
This week we will look at the Finite Volume Method (FVM) where we first will look at its conservation properties, then how control volumes relate to our mesh followed by how we can apply FVM to the Magnetostatic problem. We then look at differences between the finite methods and lastly we look at a validation experiment.
