\section{Conclusion}
We end by concluding FEM is a five step approximation method which becomes very similar in 1D and 2D problems. We have also looked at the effect of increasing the mesh resolution where we conclude we find better approximations to the unknown function as the mesh resolution increases, but we need to take into consideration that curvature conditions are applied at every element. We also conclude the boundary conditions do not define the solution of our unknown, rather the borders are attempted incorporated into the solution.
