\section{Introduction}
This week we will begin by looking at a description of different quality measures which we will later use for our experiment. We will then look into how we can create tetrahedral meshes of .obj files with the python library \textit{wildmesh}. Next we look at the Marching Triangles algorithm and how we can use it to implement a mesh generator. Lastly we will perform an experiment exploring how the \textit{stop\_quality} parameter used when creating meshes influences the quality of the generated mesh.
