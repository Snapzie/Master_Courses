\section{Conclusion}
We end by concluding the Marching Triangles algorithm is fairly simple and can create fairly good meshes, but not quite perfect. We see the meshes often have 'cut' edges, or edges where we 'steal some of the corner'. These defects are however reduced as we increase the resolution of our grid. The results we have seen were created with a 'home-made' method and could have been simplified by using a bisection algorithm to compute the intersection points. We also end by concluding that \textit{stop\_quality} have a quite significant influence on the quality of the generated meshes as we lowered the value. This is especially seen in the 'perfect regular tetrahedrals' measure which improved the most both in quality and in reduced variance. The other two measure we have looked at suggested that the quality rose as \textit{stop\_quality} had lower values, but the variance fell as \textit{stop\_quality} increased. However, comparing the Armadillo mesh at \textit{stop\_quality} 500 and 50 showed big improvements in quality for the \textit{stop\_quality} 50.
