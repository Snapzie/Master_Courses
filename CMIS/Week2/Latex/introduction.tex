\section{Introduction}
This week we will first introduce the theory behind advection and mean curvature flow and how we can discretize these. We will then look at the first experiment looking into how advection without any boundary issues behave compared to advection where boundaries will play a role. We will then look at the second experiment where we will compare three different boundary conditions and how these change the end result when applying mean curvature flow to a signed distance field. At the end we will conclude on our results.
