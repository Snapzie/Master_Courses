\section{Introduction}
This week we will look at how to apply the Finite Element Method to the Cauchy equation. We will then look at two experiments. The first looking at the elasticity of different materials and how the area of our beam changes as we apply pressure to it. The second looks at how the grid resolution impacts our approximation.
