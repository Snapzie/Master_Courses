\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion we have seen our model introduces an exponentially increasing error in increased area when we apply force to our beam. On the other hand we can also conclude the 'bend-ability' of our materials in relation to each other are as expected and thus we have verified this part of our model works correctly. We have also looked at the total displacement per grid node and area of the beam when changing the grid resolution. Here we conclude that it is hard to determine how the beam would realistically bend, but we see an increase in both total displacement per node and in area when we increase the grid resolution. The increasing area contradicts our expectation of the model accuracy increasing when increasing the grid resolution. The similarity in the graphs in \autoref{measures} could also lead one to conclude that the error in total displacement per node is proportional to the error in increased area.
