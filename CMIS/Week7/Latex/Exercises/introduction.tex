\section{Introduction}
This week we will look at how we can build a simulator for elastic objects. We will begin by applying the Finite Volume Method to the Cauchy equation and derive update rules for our simulation. We will then look at two experiments, the first looking into how we can compute an upper bound for the time steps we can take for different materials, and the second looking into how our a simulation changes based on grid resolution.
