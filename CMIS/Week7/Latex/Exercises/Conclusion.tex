\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion we have derived the application of the Finite Volume Method on the Cauchy equation and seen how we can set up a simulation loop for elastic objects. We have also seen in experiment one how we can derive an upper bound on $\Delta t$ and experimentally verified this upper bounds holds. From this experiment we concluded the upper bound is more tight for higher Young's modulus values. In experiment 2 we looked at how the lowest vertex position in the grid changed as the grid resolution increased, and here we experimentally verified that we would converge towards some fixed position as the grid got more fine. We thus end by concluding we apply our force correctly as our results from experiment 2 shows our simulation gets more accurate at we increase the mesh resolution.
