\subsection{Conclusion}
In conclusion we have seen SIFT and SURF detects roughly the same amount of features where ORB detects considerable less features. All three image descriptors perform somewhat bad when it comes to mean localization error, but this is likely due to aliasing or approximation error when transforming the images. When it comes to nearest neighbour mean average precision we see SIFT and ORB performs similar and fairly well, however SURF performs quite bad. This might be due to SIFT and ORB being both scale and rotation invariant, whereas SURF is only scale invariant. Lastly we have seen SIFT performs a lot better than both SURF and ORB when it comes to homography estimations, which is likely because SIFT both detects a lot of features and describes them well.\\
If we are to determine which of the three is better, it would depend on the task at hand. Although it is clear SIFT performs the best in the these experiments, it is also the slowest of the three. If the task requires fast feature matching it would not be possible to use SIFT, and we would need to trade performance for speed.
