\subsection{Conclusion}
In conclusion we have seen that the four similarity measures are smooth on self similarity, but becomes rather uneven on object similarity. We have also seen that the most dominant features of the images are most likely foreground and background as the optima of the object similarity is at 0 displacement for all similarity measures. We have also seen that NCC and NMI have the greatest gradients and are thus the easiest similarity measures to optimize, whereas P-norm and MI have gradients very close to 0. We have also seen none of the similarity measures are translation or rotation invariant, however MI and NMI are intensity invariant due to how they use distributions to measure similarity rather than the intensity values. Lastly we conclude affine registration is harder to optimize due to the increased number of parameters, but aligns the motif in the images slightly better than a rigid registration, although this might be a coincidence.
